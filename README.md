# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity which in our case is the telecom industry, Customer churn is the major problem in any telecom industry. We created a Predictive model using Microsoft Project tool, in this we extract churn statistics based on findings we track down the individuals who might want to stop working with the network and send email surveys to learn more about their issues. Based on the survey results, we categorize the customer complaints into distinct groups, assign teams to each group to address the complaints, and implement steps to prevent future recurrences.
This dataset helps us in predicting the behavior which in turn can be used to retain customers. We  can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes like total charges that describes the customers  information.
In this experiment, we are examining the relationships between a variety of factors, including tenure, overall costs, and telecom churn.
This correlation test identifies the variables that contribute the most to determining churn.
Azure ML software has been used to build the model, which included two-class logistic regression, two-class neural network models.
